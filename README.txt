BIOLOG

The display sizes of the objects have been adjusted for a certain window size; please execute BioLog through "build and run" or the builds available in the the "build" folder to ensure that the graphics display as intended.

The base version of BioLog referenced in [Chapter 2: The Game] is located in the folder "build base BioLog" in the "build" folder.

The adjusted version of BioLog referenced in the case study in [Chapter 3: Case Study: Use of Version-Exclusive Content to Support Group Work] is located in the folder "build adjusted BioLog" in the "build" folder.

If you are looking at the files in the Unity Engine, you can switch between the versions by navigating to scene 0: intro. Unfold the GameObject "daten". If the GameObject "sitzung name" is active, the game will execute base BioLog. If the GameObject "gruppe" is active, the game will execute the adjusted BioLog.

The scripts used in BioLog have been commented and can be viewed for further explanations about its features.
